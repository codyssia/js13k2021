**Goal:** Collect high totals in the row sums and bonuses, without letting your round score fall below the "death score."</p>

**Get points by:**
  
    Placing positive numbers in boxes
    Hitting the round target total exactly 
    Getting a row or column to total 13 (as a tribute to JS13k) 
    Getting the total of a row and column to match (if they weren't already matching)

**Lose points by:**

    Placing negative numbers in boxes
    You'll see squares with Spacey turning a pale red, then darker red, as their level of claustrophobia grows. 
    After the third level of anxiety, they freak out because they NEED their SPACE. 
    During a complete freak out, they erase the values of all the cells immediately around them.
    Time passing (a point subtracted from round score every few seconds)
